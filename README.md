All the codes are attached in a zip file! The folders are quite self explanatory- 
  1. Scrapper used to scrape data from Linkedln
  2. Preprocess folder contains preprocessing codes.
  3. The modelling codes are there in a seperate folder.
  4. And finally the integration files are put in a seperate folder. (Flask code, pickle files etc.)
